# DataQuest Project 8: Analysis of the CIA Factbook Using SQL

This is the eighth project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project data from the CIA Factbook is analyzed. This dataset contains basic information on all countries in the world, such as population_growth rate, area etc. The main focus of the project was on using python, in particular pandas to analyze `SQL` databases.

## Prerequisites

This project requires both the Jupyter notebook as well as the `DB` file containing the database with the raw information.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install) The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `sqlite3` and `matplotlib` to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
